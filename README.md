### Image after applying median filter to it

### Within the cmake-build-debug folder the previous images can be found in .pgm format, with the names "image.pgm" and "test_out.pgm" in order. 

The input text from the keyboard, on a single line, must be the following:
the algorithm type (either bubble or merge), the window size, and the names of the two files (input and output) are given, all separated by one or more whitespace characters.

Example:
merge 3 image.pgm test_out.pgm
